Just some metasploit modules and plugins. 

enum_domain_user.rb is a post exploit module that allows you to enumerate the current network for locations where a target user is logged in.

get_hosts.rb a post exploit module to retrieve a list of all hosts on the network. Basically 'net view' in meterpreter.

history.rb a msfconsole plugin to keep track of recently executed commands and play these back, in a similar manner to bash.
